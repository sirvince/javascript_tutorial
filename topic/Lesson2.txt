2. Variables
3. Datatypes
4. Concatenation
5. Activity


1. External JavaScript
- External JavaScript is when the JavaScript Code(script) is written in another file having an extension .js 
and then we link this file inside the <head> or <body> tag of our HTML file in which the code is to be added.

2. Variables
- Are temporary containers that can hold different types of data such as 
* text
* numbers
* collections
* objects
* etc.

- Variables can be named for easy read/write access by the programmer it is called an indetifier.
 
 Indetifiers
 - variable name that has been set by the programmer
    1. Identifiers must be UNIQUE
    2. Identifiers are CASE SENSITIVE
    3. RESERVE KEYWORDS are NOT allowed as Indetifiers
    4. Indetifiers MUST start with a LETTER,$ or_
    5. Identifiers  CANNOT contain SPECIAL CHARACTERS


 4 ways of Declaring Variables
    1. Automatically
    2. Using var
    3. Using let
    4. Using const

* Automatically
-- Automatically variable automatically declare themselves.
        x = 5;
        y = 12.5;
        z = "Hello World"

* Using let
-- Uses the let keyword, it cannot be redeclared. It is  preferred to be used by default when declaring variables/
        let x = 5;
        let y = 12.5;
        let z = "Hello World";

* Using const
-- Uses the const keyword, it cannot be redeclared these variables cannot be reassigned/changed.
        const x = 5;
        const y = 12.5;
        const z = "Hello Word";


* Using var
-- Uses the var keyword, it can be redeclared and shoukd only be used when you want to support older browsers.
        var x = 5;
        var y = 12.5;
        var z = "Hello Word";



3. Data types
- The types of data that the variable is currently holding.
    1. string
    2. number
    3. boolean
    4. undefined
    5. null
    6. object
    7. bigint
    8. symbol


4. Concatenation
- Joining two or more strings together.
"Hello" + "World"
"Answer : " + 12
"PI : " + 3.14
- Concatenation strings with other data types will automatically convert them into their string counterparts
